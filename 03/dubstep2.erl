% As a stress test on the system, the programs here clear the grid and then store the value 1 in square 1.
% Then, in the same allocation order as shown above, they store the sum of the values in all adjacent squares,
% including diagonals.
% 
% So, the first few squares' values are chosen as follows:
% 
% Square 1 starts with the value 1.
% Square 2 has only one adjacent filled square (with value 1), so it also stores 1.
% Square 3 has both of the above squares as neighbors and stores the sum of their values, 2.
% Square 4 has all three of the aforementioned squares as neighbors and stores the sum of their values, 4.
% Square 5 only has the first and fourth squares as neighbors, so it gets the value 5.
% Once a square is written, its value does not change.
% Therefore, the first few squares would receive the following values:
% 
% 147  142  133  122   59
% 304    5    4    2   57
% 330   10    1    1   54
% 351   11   23   25   26
% 362  747  806--->   ...
