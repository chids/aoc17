There was an internal gathering at [Schibsted](http://www.schibsted.com) around Advent of Code 2017 using a shared internal repository, these are my commits from that repository.

I chose Erlang because it has always sat well with me although I've never actually used it for real work. Before hacking on this it was probably some five years since I did anything in it, judging from some [katas](https://github.com/chids/katas).
